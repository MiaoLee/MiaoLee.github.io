## Hey there :wave:

I'm Miao Li.

I'm a watercolor and acrylic artist who loves creating art that captures the beauty of the world around us.

I’m based in Auckland, New Zealand, and I accept commissions! Whether you’re looking for a custom piece or something to make your space extra special, I’d love to collaborate.

You can reach me on:
